All the available packages are specified in the prod/config/RULES file.
These packages are built using the flash utility. e.g:
   flash run cluster
This builds the cluster package.

To prepare the packages to be built, please modify the three flags in the file
prod/packager/packager.py:
  --pkg_host - the host to store the packages
  --pkg_repo - the directory to store the packages. this directory MUST
      have a subdirectory tmp
  --pkg_user - the user to ssh to store the packages

Then modify the three flags in prod/util/queue_cluster_config_updates.py:
  --queue_config_host - the host to run the prod/cluster/conf/*.yaml modifications
  --queue_config_repo - location of a git directory for this script to automatically
      modify the prod/cluster/conf/*.yaml files
  --queue_config_user - the user to ssh to run the automatic yaml modifications

Then modify the --user, --host, and --release_dir in the prod/hotfix AND in
the prod/make_release files.
